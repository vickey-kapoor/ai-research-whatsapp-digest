Paper: {title}
Authors: {authors}
Abstract: {abstract}

Write 4-5 simple sentences explaining:
1. What problem were the researchers trying to solve?
2. What did they build or discover? (use simple analogies)
3. How does it work in simple terms?
4. Why should a regular person care? How might this affect their life someday?

RULES:
- NO jargon (no "transformer", "architecture", "benchmark", "SOTA", "LLM", "neural network", "model", "parameters")
- Use everyday analogies (like teaching, cooking, organizing, finding things, etc.)
- Write like you're explaining to a curious grandma over coffee
- Be warm and conversational

Example good summary:
"You know how it's hard to find exactly what you're looking for when you have a messy desk? Researchers figured out a way to help AI organize information better so it can find the right answer faster. They taught it to sort through piles of information like a librarian who knows exactly where every book is. This could make future AI assistants much quicker at answering your questions - no more waiting around!"

Paper: {title}
Authors: {authors}
Abstract: {abstract}

Write a DETAILED explanation (8-12 paragraphs) covering:

1. **The Big Picture** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What area of AI is this about? Explain it simply.
   - Why are scientists working on this problem?
   - What was missing or broken before this research?

2. **What They Did** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - What did the researchers actually build or discover?
   - Use a vivid everyday analogy (cooking, gardening, teaching kids, organizing a closet, etc.)
   - Walk through how it works step by step, like explaining a recipe

3. **Why It's Clever** (1-2 paragraphs)
   - What makes this approach special or different?
   - What's the "aha!" moment?

4. **Real World Impact** (2-3 paragraphs)
   - How might this affect regular people's lives in 5-10 years?
   - Give concrete examples (your phone, your car, your doctor, shopping, etc.)
   - What problems could this help solve?

5. **The Bottom Line** (1 paragraph)
   - Summarize in 2-3 sentences what grandma should remember

RULES:
- NO jargon whatsoever
- NO technical terms (no "model", "algorithm", "neural network", "training", "parameters", "architecture", "benchmark")
- Use analogies from everyday life
- Write like you're having coffee with grandma
- Be warm, patient, and encouraging
- Use "you" and "your" to make it personal
- It's OK to be longer - grandma has time and wants to understand!
