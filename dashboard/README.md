## Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production

npm start
```

## Deployment

### Vercel

1. Connect your GitHub repository to Vercel
2. Set the root directory to `dashboard/`
3. Deploy - Vercel auto-detects Next.js

The dashboard fetches data from GitHub raw content URLs in production, so it will always show the latest data after each workflow run.

## Data Sources

The dashboard reads from:
- `data/papers.json` - All fetched research papers
- `data/digests.json` - Daily digest history
- `data/config.json` - Configuration settings
- `reports/` - PDF report files

In production (Vercel), data is fetched from GitHub's raw content API with 5-minute revalidation.
